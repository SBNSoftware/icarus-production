### Notes

* **Jacob Larkin Jobs**: Nobody knows  
* **Disk Space Usage:** Promita will delete data soon. No objections up to now

### Requests

* Assigned:  
  * Request \#61 \[Thomas\]: \[RUN4\]   
    * Nearing completion. All processing stages are finished, with only the final metadata assignment remaining. An issue in the CAF stage is under investigation. A future reprocessing of Stage 1 and 2 is also anticipated  
  * Request  \#72 \[Fatima\]:   
    * Approximately 60% complete. The campaign is running smoothly, with only minor, non-critical job failures reported.   
  * Request \#75 \[Manuel/Ivan\]:  
    * Processing was intentionally paused after Stage 0 to redirect computing resources to the higher-priority WireMod campaign (Request 109). The plan for restarting these campaigns is unconfirmed and pending further discussion.  
  * Request \#83 \[Ivan\]:   
    * Done.   
  * Request \#86 \[Manuel/Ivan\]:   
    * See \#75  
  * Request \#100 \[Ivan\]: 	  
    * Done.   
    * Request \#108 \[Promita\]: 	  
    * This campaign is under test. The current focus is on test runs to ensure all metadata is correctly tracked through the LARCV stage, a critical requirement for downstream analysis.  
  * Request \#109 \[Manuel\]:  
    * Experiencing significant performance issues. Jobs require high memory (\>40GB) and disk space, leading to very long runtimes. Currently \~2% complete. The strategy is to "brute force" the processing while monitoring resource consumption.  
    * WireMod Overlay ICARUS Generation  
  * Request \#110, \#111 \[Alessandro\]:  
    * Request \#110 requires a double SAMweb def input.   
    * Request \#111 is blocked as request \#110 is a prerequisite for \#111 and cannot start until the configuration for the entire sequence is finalized.  
    * At NERSC. Spine CV-DetSim.  
    * At NERSC. Spine Omnia-DetSim. Specialized production designed to train AI/ML models. It includes a deliberate mixture of different detector variations, with the goal of making the resulting models less sensitive to systematic uncertainties when applied to real data. Stage 0 files will be kept for possible additional analysis  
  * Request \#112 \[Promita\]:  
    * Started  
    * CAF files with calibrations and updated file format, Run 2 on-beam data  
  * Request \#113 \[Antonio\]:  
    * CAF files with calibrations and updated file format, Run 2 off-beam data  
  * Request \#114 \[Ivan\]:  
    * This campaign is actively running and processing the available files as planned  
    * CAF Files for ICARUS MC Overlay

### Action Items and Open issue

* Link to [action items](https://github.com/orgs/SBNSoftware/projects/32)  
* \[Promita\] Compile a list of other potentially obsolete MC and data samples and email the collaboration for usage confirmation before any deletion  
* \[Matteo\] *icaruscode* reproducibility  
  * Stage0:  
    * Output file:

### CNAF

* **RUN3 Processing:**  
  * Processing ongoing with 37% of files submitted and 31% successfully processed   
  * Disk space (\~380TB remaining) sufficient for now, but potential space issues expected in about two weeks   
  * Off-beam transfer happening in parallel; approximately half of the files copied   
  * Run 5 transfer still to begin; will start with copying to tape due to disk space concerns

### Keepup

* \[Ivan\]:   
  * NTR

### Infrastructure

* \[Giuseppe\]:  
  * NTR

### Software

* \[Tracy\]:   
  * NTR

### Computing

* \[Vito\]:  
  * POMS had submission issues overnight but has been fixed  
  * Resilient DCache area: Files older than 30 days will be removed at the end of October  
  * Direct Prestage not working with current token; requires new Storage.Stage scope  
  * NERSC: Setup for GPU and Triton server deployment in progress; initially for Nova, soon for ICARUS  
  * Production priority parameters have limited configuration options; mainly controlled by fair-sharing algorithms
